# A Better Distrokid HyperFollow Page

I released a [single](https://jeromejaglale.com/links/music/brave.html) and an [album](https://jeromejaglale.com/links/music/space_bubbles.html) through [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/3369617). It was easy. They do a great job at taking care of the hassle of submitting music to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.

[The HyperFollow page](https://support.distrokid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013647913), automatically generated, conveniently provides direct links to the music on those platforms.

But there are significant problems with the HyperFollow page:
- includes **no less than 7 trackers** (Google, Bing, Tik Tok..)
- **slow** and **consumes too much data**

So I rebuilt it from scratch:
- **no trackers**
- it loads **5 times faster**
- it's **15 times smaller**

For more information and how to use it, see my blog post at https://jeromejaglale.com/blog/rebuilding_distrokid_hyperfollow_page
